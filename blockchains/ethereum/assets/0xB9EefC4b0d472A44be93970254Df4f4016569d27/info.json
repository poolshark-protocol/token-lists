The burn was done to avoid confusion as well as to provide reassurance that the majority of the original 100B ERC20 tokens total supply would not find its way into circulation.    For additional details regarding the XDB token, please visit the DigitalBits token webpage https://digitalbits.io/token-sale-terms/  Please follow the Medium account for updates and further insight: https://medium.com/digitalbitsorg/tagged/report",
